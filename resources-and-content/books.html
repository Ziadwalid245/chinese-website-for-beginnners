           <p>
            books are a pretty essential tool for learning any skill. 
            the way i see it there are no "good" or "bad" books when youre learning 
            a language because i think all books will give you a more organised way 
            to practice and approach learning grammar and vocabulary wether it is through lessons and 
            example dialouges or just through the old way of writing the grammar rule 
            and give you example sentences , all books are a valuable way to to practice 
            and reinforce concepts (which is pretty important).
           </p>

           <p>
            a peice of advice that i can give in regards to using the books
            below  or any book you wanna buy for that matter is that after going through a 
            lesson or two and learning some vocabulary , you may feel like you have a 
            solid grasp on the material and the language , but you dont , learning 
            a language isnt just about memorising some phrases or getting through a lesson 
            its about being able to use what youve learned in an actual conversation ,
            so id recommend after youre done with a lesson practice the excersices given 
            the excersise will show where your true weaknesses lie and what you 
            really understand and what to improve on .

           </p>

           <p>
            there no 'bad' language books and that is true , but if a language 
            book doenst let you practice what you learned , its pretty lacking 
            in quality
           </p>
