                    <a href="https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/">Chinese Grammar Wiki</a>
                    is a really great website to understand confusing grammar points,
                    they cover common beginner questions Like how to use 有 and 也,
                    difference between the negation using 沒 and 不, and even
                    intermediate and advanced topics (Although the advanced section is
                    still being edited) like how to use 地 and 得, how to use 把 and
                    被 and how to use 似乎
                </p>
                <p>
                    The explanations are brief, straight to the point and with a large
                    number of example sentences this is an indispensable resource for
                    any Chinese learner.

                <h2>Forvo</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="/images/website-thumbnails/forvo-logo.svg" alt="forvo-logo.png" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://forvo.com/"></a>
                    Forvo is a site where you can listen to native speakers pronounce
                    certain words . I find that pretty useful as Chinese has a lot of
                    two syllable words and one tone could change depending on the tone
                    after it.
                </p>

                <p>

                <ul>
                    <li> For example:
                        When a 3rd tone is followed by another 3rd tone in a group, the first 3rd tone changes to a 2nd
                        tone
                        like : 你好will be written as (nǐ hǎo) ,but will be pronounced as （ní hǎo）.
                    </li>

                    <li>When followed by a 4th tone, 不 (bù) changes to 2nd tone (bú).
                        Like: 不对(bùduì) will be pronounced with two 4th tones but pronounced as “búduì.”
                    </li>


                    <li>When followed by a 4th tone, 一 (yī) changes to 2nd tone (yí)
                        Like : 一个 (yīgè) will be pronounced as “ yígè ”.
                    </li>

                    <li>when followed by any other tone, (yī) changes to 4th tone .
                        like: 一起 (yīqǐ), will be pronounced as “yìqǐ.”
                    </li>
                </ul>
                So it’s pretty helpful to hear native speakers pronounce the words.

                <h2>Line Dictionary</h2>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="https://dict.naver.com/linedict/zhendict/dict.html#/cnen/home">
                        <img id="line-dictonary-img" src="/images/website-thumbnails/line-chinese-dictionary.png"
                            alt="line-chinese-dictionary.png" />
                    </a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Line is a pretty decent dictionary to use if you’re on a pc or a laptop most of the time, the
                    dictionary not only shows you how to write each word when you look it up（some mobile apps like
                    hangping make that a paid feature）, it also has a way for you to write characters you don’t know by
                    click on the brush icon next to the search icon, but isn’t the smoothest thing to use on a computer,
                    still it’s one the best online dictionaries I’ve managed to find
                </p>

                <p>
                    I would also recommend downloading  hangping or pleco to use on your phone.
                </p>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="/images/website-thumbnails/baidu-translate.png" alt="baidu-translate.png" />
                </div>

                <p> <a href="https://fanyi.baidu.com/#zh/en/">Baidu Translate </a> is a a great site for translating sentences from English , Spanish , German and a variety of languages  to and from Chinese  and is surprisingly accurate (I prefer it over google translate) and is a great way to check if your sentences are correct or not  , it works really great for small sentences and paragraphs , but if you want to translate an entire essay or short story in Chinese you start to have some problems.</p>
                <p>personally when I translated large texts ( articles on historical figures , historical events , poetry , or even just some  dialogue ) some words wouldn’t be translated , I would end up with weird sentences like :"After graduation from college,
                    my husband met his current
                    husband, and then fell in love
                    and got married, and became a
                    housewife."
                    </p>

                <p>
                    
                    All in all a great resource to correct simple sentence and understand the basic theme and concepts of large text, but wouldn’t rely on it too much.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    
 You can also download the mobile app ( from a pretty sketchy Chinese site) to take pictures of an entire document or text and it will give you a translation for it .
