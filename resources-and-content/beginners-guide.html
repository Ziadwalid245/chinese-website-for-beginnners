           <h1>HOW TO NOT ABSOLUTELY HATE CHINESE AND QUIT HALFWAY THROUGH </h1>
           <p>
            Before we start a little word to the wise , learning a language or anything really is a like filling a pool with water one table spoon at a time , tedious , painful and some  point halfway you’ll say “ is this even worth it “, if you want to get good at something you’re going to have to keep at it , even well after your conversational or “fluent” , your learning won’t stop ever , you will keep learning new characters and grammar points all the time .
           </p>
           <p>
            So the way to think about is you won’t be fluent , you’ll just make less and less mistakes as time goes on , so get comfortable because if you really want to learn , you’re in this for the long haul.


           </p>

        <p>
            
And with that out of the way let’s get to it, the three things I’m going to talk about are 
  <ol>
    <li>Mindset</li>
    <li>Characters</li>
    <li>Grammar</li>
    <li>Listening</li>
  </ol>

                <p>
                    Focus on the process not the result, I believe that for the most part fluency is more or less a myth , my mindset going into learning Chinese was I want to be as good as a native speaker , which at first glance ( at least to me ) seemed like a good goal, but it wasn’t , it was a very destructive one , because what I failed to realize was, even native speakers made mistakes, didn’t understand some words and phrases, mess up pronunciation and tones and  <a href="https://youtu.be/zxHskrqMqII"> even forgot how to write characters</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/sU0zagnWeh8">I also didn't understand what fluency meant</a>
                    , fluency to me was about being perfect, speaking perfectly, writing perfectly, knowing about characters and idioms that even Chinese people themselves didn’t know but I came to realize that instead of focusing on being fluent and perfect, I should focus more on enjoying the the learning process itself, instead of memorizing words, and worrying if I sound native enough.
