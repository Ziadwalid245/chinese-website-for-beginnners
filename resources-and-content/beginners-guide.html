           <p>
            Before we start a little word to the wise , learning a language or anything really is a like filling a pool with water one table spoon at a time , tedious , painful and some  point halfway you’ll say “ is this even worth it “, if you want to get good at something you’re going to have to keep at it , even well after your conversational or “fluent” , your learning won’t stop ever , you will keep learning new characters and grammar points all the time .
           </p>
           <p>
            So the way to think about is you won’t be fluent , you’ll just make less and less mistakes as time goes on , so get comfortable because if you really want to learn , you’re in this for the long haul.


           </p>

        <p>
            
And with that out of the way let’s get to it, the three things I’m going to talk about are 
  <ol>
    <li>Mindset</li>
    <li>Characters</li>
    <li>Grammar</li>
    <li>Listening</li>
  </ol>
