                    is a great channle for beginners , she has a simple way of explaining complicated topics from grammar
                  points like æŠŠ  to tounge positions when pronouncing syllables , she also has some vlogs that she posted
                  that have chinese subtitles (no pinyin) and english translation , and theyre a great way to practice 
                  your listening skills .
                </p>

                <p>i would recommend watching her video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD8Df7k4PHI&t=65s&ab_channel=GraceMandarinChinese">Chinese sentence structure</a>
                and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzM8vD9N6fg&ab_channel=GraceMandarinChinese">must-have learning tools</a>
                as a start , and if youre feeling brave check out her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpQ3IMd4AMg&list=PLwFUKjRMEUxw2IRsDA8GZGW1AZdgCoiAA">chinese pronounciation playlist</a>
                especially helpful if youre recording your voice and comparing it to natice speakers whch is a good habit to get into early
            ( peice of advice dont pick too many videos to copy , just one and stick to it ).</p>

            <p> she also has some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMGO9CZE2vs&list=PLwFUKjRMEUxxnJubAVwyZ3RaUoZcqwZ3m&index=2&ab_channel=GraceMandarinChinese">good TV show recommendations</a>.</p>

                    is a channel that is mostly grammar focused , they have a great way of explaining
                   confusing and/or complicated grammar points and structures , a peice of advice though , 
                   and forget what you actually wanted to know in the first place( that never happened to me , a 
                   friend told me )
                   
                </p>
                
                <p>
                      avoid jumping from one grammar video to the next , only watch 
                      a video about the grammar point you dont understand and move on , otherwise 
                      youll overwhelm yourself and wont learn anything.

                        has mostly short stories and kids rhymes that are rarely longer than 10 minutes , 
                        the videos are spoken slowly , are easy to follow along and use simple chaacters 
                        which is great if you are a beginner , as most chinese content i found were either 
                        too fast to follow or hard to understand as they used alot of complicated charatcers 
                        , lucky for you you wont find any of that here ,   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         this channel is a great place to start moving away from using pinyin 
                         and english translations to understand videos and instead use your own knowledge 
                         to understand whats going on , and the easy content and slow pace will help you do 
                         just that.
